# Drew Casebeer Individual Project

### Problem Statement
While hosting a movie streaming service is fun you are often left with the
daunting question of what your users actually want to watch. The goal of 
this project will be to create a web application where people can vote and 
suggest new movies that they would like to see included in the service. These 
votes will later be tallied and sent to an API to capture what the highest 
voted movies are. A large source of the API usage will be used for pulling 
the information from several different websites including but not limited 
to Images, Year Released, as well as the current ranking for that movie in 
their lists.
